# Add your database file name if it's specific and versioned,
# but typically you want the actual DB file from userData to be ignored
# if it's committed by mistake from a dev environment.
# For this project, the DB will be in app.getPath('userData'),
# so it won't be in the project repo directly.
# However, if you create temp dbs in the project for testing, ignore them.
# e.g. /packages/electron-app/my_dev_database.db
